# ⚡ NEON BARRAGE

> **A fast-paced neon survival shooter built with pure JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas**

**Neon Barrage** is a top-down arcade shooter where survival is the only goal.  
Enemies spawn in increasingly dangerous waves, new behaviors unlock over time, and quick reflexes are your only defense in a glowing cyber arena.

This game is built **from scratch** using only core web technologies — no frameworks, no libraries, no game engines.
